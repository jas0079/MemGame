Are you ready to test your memory before the night falls?
Your goal is to match 2 cards with the same picture on it within the shortest amount of time possible.

There are a total of 16 cards and a total of 8 possible 2 card matches. If it takes too many moves, you will lose a bright yellow star. So the beat the dark, complete the game with as less moves as possible.
